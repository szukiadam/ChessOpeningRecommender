    description: |
      Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. See scikit-learn's [StandardScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html#sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler) for full documentation.

      Will append a new column with the name &lt;source column&gt;_scaled.

      Example usage:
      #### **`models\customer_features.yml:`**
      ```
      {{ '{{' }} config(materialized='view') {{ '}}' }}

      {{ '{{' }} dbt_ml_preprocessing.standard_scaler( ref('customer') ,'age') {{ '}}' }}

      ```
      Will produce a model named customer_features, with a new column named ```age_scaled``` containing the scaled values.
    arguments:
      - name: source_table
        type: string
        description: Pass in a ref to the table containing the data you want to transform
      - name: source_column
        type: list
        description: The columns containing the data you want to transform
      - name: include_columns
        type: string
        description: Other columns from the source table to be included in the model (defaults to '*' and brings all columns across)
      - name: with_mean
        type: string
        description: If True, center the data before scaling. Only supports the default value of 'True' at this time.
